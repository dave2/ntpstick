Notes on Kicad source files for NTPstick
========================================

- These files require the current upstream source of Kicad to be read.
  In general, versions shipped with most distributions are not new 
  enough to read these files. At least r5256 is required from the Kicad
  source repo.

- I have not included separate libraries or footprints that were created
  for this project. I'll include them at some future point.
